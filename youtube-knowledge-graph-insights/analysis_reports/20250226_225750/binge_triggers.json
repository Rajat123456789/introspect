    "trigger_title": "Far from being solo operators, most single-celled microbes are in complex relationships. In the ocean, the soil and your gut, they might battle and eat each other, exchange DNA, compete for nutrients, or feed on one another\u2019s by-products. Sometimes they get even more intimate: One cell might slip inside another and make itself comfortable. If the conditions are just right, it might stay and be welcomed, sparking a relationship that could last for generations \u2014 or billions of years. This phenomenon of one cell living inside another, called endosymbiosis, has fueled the evolution of complex life.\n\nExamples of endosymbiosis are everywhere. Mitochondria, the energy factories in your cells, were once free-living bacteria. Photosynthetic plants owe their sun-spun sugars to the chloroplast, which was also originally an independent organism. Many insects get essential nutrients from bacteria that live inside them. And last year researchers discovered the \u201cnitroplast,\u201d an endosymbiont that helps some algae process nitrogen.\n\nSo much of life relies on endosymbiotic relationships, but scientists have struggled to understand how they happen. How does an internalized cell evade digestion? How does it learn to reproduce inside its host? What makes a random merger of two independent organisms into a stable, lasting partnership?\n\nNow, for the first time, researchers have watched the opening choreography of this microscopic dance by inducing endosymbiosis in the lab. After injecting bacteria into a fungus \u2014 a process that required creative problem-solving (and a bicycle pump) \u2014 the researchers managed to spark cooperation without killing the bacteria or the host. Their observations offer a glimpse into the conditions that make it possible for the same thing to happen in the microbial wild.\n\nRead the full story: https://www.quantamagazine.org/scientists-re-create-the-microbial-dance-that-sparked-complex-life-20250102/",

    "trigger_title": "In the fall of 1915, the foundations of physics began to crack. Einstein\u2019s new theory of gravity seemed to imply that it should be possible to create and destroy energy, a result that threatened to upend two centuries of thinking in physics.\n \nEinstein\u2019s theory, called general relativity, radically transformed the meaning of space and time. Rather than being fixed backdrops to the events of the universe, space and time were now characters in their own right, able to curve, expand and contract in the presence of matter and energy.\n \nOne problem with this shifting space-time is that as it stretches and shrinks, the density of the energy inside it changes. As a consequence, the classical energy conservation law that previously described all of physics didn\u2019t fit this framework. David Hilbert, one of the most prominent mathematicians at the time, quickly identified this issue and set out with his colleague Felix Klein to try to resolve this apparent failure of relativity. After they were stumped, Hilbert passed the problem on to his assistant, the 33-year-old Emmy Noether.\n \nNoether was an assistant in name only. She was already a formidable mathematician when, in early 1915, Hilbert and Klein invited her to join them at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. But other faculty members objected to hiring a woman, and Noether was blocked from joining the faculty. Regardless, she would spend the next three years prodding the fault line separating physics and mathematics, eventually setting off an earthquake that would shake the foundations of fundamental physics.\n \nIn 1918, Noether published the results of her investigations in two landmark theorems. One made sense of conservation laws in small regions of space, a mathematical feat that would later prove important for understanding the symmetries of quantum field theory. The other, now just known as Noether\u2019s theorem, says that behind every conservation law lies a deeper symmetry.\n \n\ud83d\udd17 Read the full explainer: https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-noethers-theorem-revolutionized-physics-20250207/\n\n\ud83c\udfa8 Kristina Armitage/Quanta Magazine",

The metaphor leaps out: Like letters of the alphabet, molecules (the nucleotide bases A, T, C and G, for adenine, thymine, cytosine and guanine) are arranged into sequences \u2014 words, paragraphs, chapters, perhaps \u2014 in every organism, from bacteria to humans. Like a language, they encode information. But humans can\u2019t easily read or interpret these instructions for life. We cannot, at a glance, tell the difference between a DNA sequence that functions in an organism and a random string of A\u2019s, T\u2019s, C\u2019s and G\u2019s. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for humans to understand biological sequence,\u201d said the computer scientist Brian Hie, who heads the Laboratory of Evolutionary Design at Stanford University, based at the nonprofit Arc Institute. This was the impetus behind his new invention, named Evo: a genomic large language model (LLM), which he describes as ChatGPT for DNA.\n\nChatGPT was trained on enormous volumes of written English text, from which the algorithm learned patterns that let it read and write original sentences. Similarly, Evo was trained on enormous volumes of DNA \u2014 300 billion base pairs from 2.7 million bacterial, archaeal and viral genomes \u2014 to glean functional information from stretches of DNA that a user inputs as prompts. A more complete understanding of the code for life, Hie said, could accelerate biological design: the creation of better biological tools to improve medicine and the environment. \n\nHie became interested in using language models for biology during graduate school, when he began building protein LLMs, which can predict how proteins fold and help design new ones. Proteins are molecular machines encoded by DNA in the wordlike segments we call genes. But an organism\u2019s genome \u2014 the entire length of its DNA \u2014 represents more information than a list of proteins, just as a sentence contains more information than a list of words. Biologists are still struggling to understand the grammar of DNA. What\u2019s more, genomes include many regions that do not code for proteins. Hie wondered: What if machine learning could help make sense of the whole genetic library?\n\n\ud83e\uddec Read the full interview: https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-poetry-fan-who-taught-an-llm-to-read-and-write-dna-20250205/\n\n\ud83d\udcf7 Rachel Bujalski for Quanta Magazine",

    "trigger_title": "Graphs are common in coding interviews, but they are used in many other places too. \n\nFor example, the Six degrees of separation is the idea that all people (vertices) are six or fewer social connections (edges) away from each other. \n\n\nHere's a list of 5 common graph algorithms that are common in coding interviews.\n\n\n1. Depth First Search (DFS)\nPrioritizes depth first. This search will go as deep as possible exploring each node before hitting the base case, after which it explores other nodes. A hash set is used to keep track of visited nodes.\n\n\n2. Breadth First Search (BFS)\nPrioritizes breadth first. It explores all possible neighbors of a vertex before moving on to the next level of neighbors, sometimes also called layers. This uses a queue and a hash set, and can be used to find the length of the shortest path from one vertex to the other.\n\n\n3. Union-Find\nUsed to combine disjoint sets. It's useful for when we want to know the number of connected components in a graph. It's also used in Kruskal's algorithm for detecting cycles.\n\n\n4. Topological Sort\nImplemented on a directed acyclic graph, it's used to order vertices such that for every directed edge u -> v, vertex u appears before vertex v. This is useful if an interview problem talks about pre-requisites where one condition must be fulfilled before moving on to the next. \n\n\n5. Dijkstra's Algorithm\nA greedy algorithm that operates on weighted graphs, used to find the shortest path from one source to all other vertices in the graph. It uses a min heap to pick the shortest path at each step and a hash set to avoid cycles.\n\n\nTo download the full cheat sheet with code samples see: https://neetcode.io/courses/lessons/5-graph-algorithms\n\n(it's free and I won't collect your email)",

    "trigger_title": "Top 8 Data Structures for Coding Interviews. \n\n\nYou can download the high resolution version using the link at the bottom \ud83d\udc47\n\n\n1. Arrays\n\nThe most fundamental data structure. Arrays are stored contiguously in memory.\n\n2. Linked Lists\n\nThese also store an ordered list of elements, but the values are not contiguous in RAM. Linked list nodes have pointers connecting them.\n\n3. HashMaps\n\nProbably the most useful data structure as well. They use a hash function to map keys to indexes within an array. This allows us to have an amortized time of O(1) for most operations.\n\n4. Queues\n\nTypically used to process elements in the same order as they are added. These follow a FIFO (first-in first-out approach). Queues can be double-ended, which allow you to add and remove elements from both the front and the back.\n\n5. Trees\n\nA Binary Tree is an ordered tree data structure where each node is connected to at most two more nodes (called the left and the right child). Being ordered means we can perform DFS and BFS in O(log n) time.\n\n6. Tries/Prefix Trees\n\nHere, each node represents a character in the alphabet and can have at most 26 children. This allows us to save space when inserting words. Tries are useful for auto-complete features and allow us to search for words using their prefix.\n\n7. Heaps\n\nHeaps are a nearly complete binary tree, with potentially the last level being not full. They are implemented with arrays under the hood. Heaps serve as priority queues, and always have the smallest (min-heap) or the largest (max-heap) item stored at the root node.\n\n8. Graphs\n\nA graph is a bunch of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Linked Lists and Trees are also special type of graphs, but a more general graph can have an arbitrary number of vertices connected to it. A good way to represent graphs in interviews is through an adjacency list.\n\n\nYou can find the high resolution image & cheat sheet here: http://neetcode.io/courses/lessons/8-data-structures\n(free & mobile friendly)",
